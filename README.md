## Introduction

Tipsy is a web application that allows users to locate the nearest happy hour to them. With the growing popularity of happy hour their are very little resources in terms of finding a good happy hour in town. This application takes it a step forward and locates happy hour with full menu and descriptions. Tipsy uses Leaflet.js for the mapping and yelp API for the restaurant info. React and Sass was used to build the front-end and express and node js was used to build the backend.

once logged in a user will be directed to the map with initial location. The map will be centered to a default location with restaurants listed and choice of happy hours and times.
